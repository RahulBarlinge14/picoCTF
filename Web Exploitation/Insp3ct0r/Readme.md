In this question, we are given with a [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/). 

After clicking on the link we will be shown a web page which says 'Inspect Me'.

So to inspect the site, right click anywhere on the web page and choose ```Inspect```.

There you can see a file named ```mycss.css``` and ```myjs.js```.

Let us visit the ```mycss.css```.

Here we can see from the image, we have found the part 2 of the flag!!
